# PeteThinkfulv3 this project was a challenge for me, but I got through it. :) I built this website based on the guidnace from the lesson, and the reviewers who provided me feedback each time.  I took the liberty of making a couple of customer changs to the HTML code and the CSS code this time, with <HR> settinggs, and adding a new componenet of <div container> and .container in the CSS when centering LISTS.  I am interested if this is the right approach or not, and would like to know if there is a preffered approach to address this issue in the future.
